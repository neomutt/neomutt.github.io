# NeoMutt Web Site

This is the source of the NeoMutt Web Site.

Unless you are a web Zen master, you probably want to look at the rendered
version:

  https://www.neomutt.org/

# Please don't edit the Neomutt Guide section here!

The neomutt guide at https://www.neomutt.org/guide/ is generated by some
half-automated scripts from
[our documentation](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/neomutt/doc/manual.xml.head).
That means, you should post your fixes there, if they affect the Neomutt guide.


Thanks!
