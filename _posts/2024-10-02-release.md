## :book: Notes

This is mostly a bug-fix release, but there are two bigger changes to note.

First, it features the start of some work to improve message security.
(if you're knowledgeable and brave, see `$devel_security` below)

Second, it removes support for Mixmaster -- an anonymous remailer.
That was quite a lot of code that nobody used for many years.
