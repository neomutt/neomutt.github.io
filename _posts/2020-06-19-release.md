## :book: Notes

This release of NeoMutt includes **important** security fixes.

Besides lots of bug-fixes, there are some small new features.

- Config supports '+=' and '-=' for numeric types
  There are more changes to come, to make the config more flexible.

- Address book / Query menus support comments
  Any text after a `#` will be shown in the menu (and can be searched).
  When saving an alias, you will be prompted for an optional comment.
