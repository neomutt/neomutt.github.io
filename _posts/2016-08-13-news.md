# Two Hundred Stars on GitHub

Since the first release, just five months ago, we've achieved so much.

We're a small band of developers and Mutt enthusiasts who want to see modern
features in Mutt.

So far, we've added 23 features, and have 4 more in development.  Also there
are 2 contrib features.  On top of this we've done lots of testing, fixed lots
of bugs and created a mountain of documentation.

To get these features to the users, we're been working closely with many
distros to provide ready-made packages of NeoMutt:

- Arch
- Debian
- Fedora (COPR)
- FreeBSD
- Gentoo
- HomeBrew (OSX)
- NetBSD (pkgsrc)
- Suse

Perhaps our greatest achievement, though, is getting the Sidebar accepted into
upstream Mutt.  After ten years on the sidelines, it's in!

Many thanks to everyone who's been helping to make NeoMutt a success.
Long may it continue!

## What have we Achieved?

### Features

Each of these 23 features is available as a
[separate patch](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/releases/tag/neomutt-20160808)
against Mutt-1.6.2, or as part of the NeoMutt package.

They are maintained against the latest stable version of Mutt, they've been
tidied up and tested.  Also, each comes with documentation and a sample muttrc.
