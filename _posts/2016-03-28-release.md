title: Release - Skip-Quoted, Limit-Current-Thread
---

New to NeoMutt this release:

- [Skip-Quoted]({{ site.url }}/feature/skip-quoted) Skip Quoted Text
- [Limit-Current-Thread]({{ site.url }}/feature/limit-current-thread) Limit Index View to Current Thread

[Skip-Quoted]({{ site.url }}/feature/skip-quoted) shows some context when using the `<skip-quoted>`
function.

[Limit-Current-Thread]({{ site.url }}/feature/limit-current-thread) allows you to limit the index view
to just the current thread.

These new features are the work of David Sterba (kdave).
