## Big Bugfix Release

First, many thanks to new NeoMutt contributors: Alex Pearce,
Stephen Gilles and Olaf Lessenich

This release sees lots of bug fixes.
Thank you to all the people who reported problems.

### Bug Fixes

- Fix crash caused by sidebar_folder_indent
- Allow the user to change mailboxes again
- Correct sidebar's messages counts
- Only sort the sidebar if we're asked to
- Fix refresh of pager when toggling the sidebar
- Compose mode: make messages respect the TITLE_FMT
- Conditional include if sys/syscall.h
- Build fix for old compilers
- Try harder to keep track of the open mailbox

### Changes to Features

- Allow `sidebar_divider_char` to be longer
  (it was limited to one character)
- Ignore case when sorting the sidebar alphabetically

### Other Changes

- Numerous small tweaks to the docs
- Lots of minor code tidy-ups
- Enabling NotMuch now forcibly enables Sidebar
  (it is dependent on it, for now)
- A couple of bug fixes from mutt/stable

These patches apply to Mutt-1.6.0
