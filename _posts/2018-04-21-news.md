## Start Coding on NeoMutt (with help)

- Are you a keen NeoMutt user?
- Would you like to help the NeoMutt Project?
- Can you write code in C?
- Do you know the basics of git version control)?

We've documented some "easy" coding tasks and we're looking for volunteers.

The tasks are:

- **Simple** - You don't need to be a C master to do them
- **Understandable** - You don't need to know the insides of NeoMutt
- **Low priority** - If it takes you a while, it doesn't matter
- **Mentored** - A NeoMutt project member will be assigned to help you

Get involved. **YOU** can make a difference!

Thanks ♥ The NeoMutt Team
