## :book: Notes

Here we are again.

Unfortunately, last week's release contained a few clumsy bugs.
Sorry about that.

With such complex code and only three developers, sometimes we miss things.
If you spot a problem with NeoMutt, please report it as soon as you can.

This release contains a couple of fixes for the IMAP behaviour.
They should make IMAP connections more reliable.
