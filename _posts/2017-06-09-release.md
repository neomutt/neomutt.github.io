## Notes

This is a second bug-fix release
It tidies up a few small problems from last week's release
(like the missing ChangeLog :-)

- **[@NeoMutt_Org](https://twitter.com/NeoMutt_Org)** - Follow us on **Twitter**!
- Six features are now "always built" as part of NeoMutt: sidebar, imap, pop, smtp, compressed, nntp.
  These features have no build dependencies and don't add much to the size.

## Key Bindings

https://www.neomutt.org/guide/configuration#bind-warnings

With the config, below, the 'g' mapping will not be usable.

```
bind index g  group-reply
bind index gg first-entry
```

This is a limitation of Mutt.
NeoMutt now warns you if you overwrite key bindings.
To fix the warning, first disable the mapping:

```
bind index g  noop
bind index gg first-entry
```
