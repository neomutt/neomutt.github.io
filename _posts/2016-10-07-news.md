## Start Coding on NeoMutt (with help)

- Are you a keen NeoMutt user?
- Would you like to help the NeoMutt Project?
- Can you write code in C?

I've documented six "easy" coding tasks and I'm looking for volunteers.

The tasks are:

- **Simple**         -- You don't need to be a C master to do them
- **Understandable** -- You don't need to know the insides of NeoMutt
- **Low priority**   -- If it takes you a while, it doesn't matter
- **Mentored**       -- A NeoMutt project member will be assigned to help you

[List of tasks](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20label%3Adifficulty%3Aeasy%20no%3Aassignee):

- Add New Hooks for Startup and Shutdown
- Sidebar Divider Improvement
- set variable = $default
- Create a new variable $net_folder_format
- Forgotten Attachment Improvement
- Clean the NeoMutt Build

Get involved.  **YOU** can make a difference!
