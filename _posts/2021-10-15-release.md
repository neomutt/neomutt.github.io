## :book: Notes

There hasn't been a NeoMutt release for eight months, but we haven't been idle.
We've spent the time making some huge architectural improvements to the code.
Of course, big changes come with the risk that we might have broken things.

We're happy that NeoMutt is stable and ready for general use, once again,
and we encourage you to upgrade.

If you find any problems please let us know as soon as possible.
(There will probably be a bug-fix release in a week or two)

Config: If you want new mail to be detected automatically, make sure that you
have the config `set mail_check_stats = yes`

This now applies in a few more places, including Notmuch mailboxes.
