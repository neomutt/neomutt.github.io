# NeoMutt Website

## What's it made of?

This is the website of [The NeoMutt Project](/about.html). It was
created by Richard Russon ([FlatCap](https://github.com/flatcap)).

The site is hosted at [{{site.url}}]({{site.url}})
by [GitHub](https://github.com/) on their [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The pages were created using a mix of HTML and
[Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html), a flavour of Markdown
They are then processed by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (a static-website generator).

The site's theme is loosely based on Scott Emmons'
[Jekyll-Clean](https://github.com/scotte/jekyll-clean).
It also uses Twitter's [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
framework and a colour scheme from Ian Wootten's
[jekyll-syntax](https://github.com/iwootten/jekyll-syntax) collection.
