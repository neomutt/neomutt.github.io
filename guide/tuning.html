    <p>NeoMutt's performance when reading mailboxes can be improved in two ways:</p>
    <div class="orderedlist">
      <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>For remote folders (IMAP and POP) as well as folders using one-file-per message storage (Maildir and MH), NeoMutt's performance can be greatly improved using
          <a class="link" href="optionalfeatures.html#header-caching" title="8.1.&#160;Header Caching">header caching</a>. using a single database per folder.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>NeoMutt provides the
          <a class="link" href="reference.html#read-inc" title="3.390.&#160;read_inc">$read_inc</a> and
          <a class="link" href="reference.html#write-inc" title="3.552.&#160;write_inc">$write_inc</a> variables to specify at which rate to update progress counters. If these values are too low, NeoMutt may spend more time on updating the progress counter than it spends on actually reading/writing folders.</p>
          <p>For example, when opening a maildir folder with a few thousand messages, the default value for
          <a class="link" href="reference.html#read-inc" title="3.390.&#160;read_inc">$read_inc</a> may be too low. It can be tuned on on a folder-basis using
          <a class="link" href="configuration.html#folder-hook" title="9.&#160;Setting Variables Based Upon Mailbox">
          <span class="command">
            <strong>folder-hook</strong>
          </span>s</a>:</p>
          <pre class="screen">
<span class="comment"># use very high $read_inc to speed up reading hcache'd maildirs</span>
folder-hook . 'set read_inc=1000'
<span class="comment"># use lower value for reading slower remote IMAP folders</span>
folder-hook ^imap 'set read_inc=100'
<span class="comment"># use even lower value for reading even slower remote POP folders</span>
folder-hook ^pop 'set read_inc=1'
</pre>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <p>These settings work on a per-message basis. However, as messages may greatly differ in size and certain operations are much faster than others, even per-folder settings of the increment variables may not be desirable as they produce either too few or too much progress updates. Thus, NeoMutt allows to limit the number of progress updates per second it'll actually send to the terminal using the
    <a class="link" href="reference.html#time-inc" title="3.520.&#160;time_inc">$time_inc</a> variable.</p>
  </div>

          <a id="messages"></a>2.&#160;Reading Messages from Remote Folders</h2>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Reading messages from remote folders such as IMAP an POP can be slow especially for large mailboxes since NeoMutt only caches a very limited number of recently viewed messages (usually 10) per session (so that it will be gone for the next session.)</p>
    <p>To improve performance and permanently cache whole messages and headers, please refer to
    <a class="link" href="optionalfeatures.html#body-caching" title="8.2.&#160;Body Caching">body caching</a> and
    <a class="link" href="optionalfeatures.html#header-caching" title="8.1.&#160;Header Caching">header caching</a> for details.</p>
    <p>Additionally, it may be worth trying some of NeoMutt's experimental features.
    <a class="link" href="reference.html#imap-qresync" title="3.204.&#160;imap_qresync">$imap_qresync</a>(which requires header caching) can provide a huge speed boost opening mailboxes if your IMAP server supports it.
    <a class="link" href="reference.html#imap-deflate" title="3.189.&#160;imap_deflate">$imap_deflate</a> enables compression, which can also noticeably reduce download time for large mailboxes and messages.</p>

          <a id="search"></a>3.&#160;Searching and Limiting</h2>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>When searching mailboxes either via a search or a limit action, for some patterns NeoMutt distinguishes between regular expression and string searches. For regular expressions, patterns are prefixed with
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">~</span>”</span> and with
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">=</span>”</span> for string searches.</p>
    <p>Even though a regular expression search is fast, it's several times slower than a pure string search which is noticeable especially on large folders. As a consequence, a string search should be used instead of a regular expression search if the user already knows enough about the search pattern.</p>
    <p>For example, when limiting a large folder to all messages sent to or by an author, it's much faster to search for the initial part of an e-mail address via
    <code class="literal">=Luser@</code> instead of
    <code class="literal">~Luser@</code>. This is especially true for searching message bodies since a larger amount of input has to be searched.</p>
    <p>As for regular expressions, a lower case string search pattern makes NeoMutt perform a case-insensitive search except for IMAP (because for IMAP NeoMutt performs server-side searches which don't support case-insensitivity).</p>
