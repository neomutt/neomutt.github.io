    <p>A
    <span class="quote">“
    <span class="quote">character set</span>”</span> is basically a mapping between bytes and glyphs and implies a certain character encoding scheme. For example, for the ISO 8859 family of character sets, an encoding of 8bit per character is used. For the Unicode character set, different character encodings may be used, UTF-8 being the most popular. In UTF-8, a character is represented using a variable number of bytes ranging from 1 to 4.</p>
    <p>Since NeoMutt is a command-line tool run from a shell, and delegates certain tasks to external tools (such as an editor for composing/editing messages), all of these tools need to agree on a character set and encoding. There exists no way to reliably deduce the character set a plain text file has. Interoperability is gained by the use of well-defined environment variables. The full set can be printed by issuing
    <code class="literal">locale</code> on the command line.</p>
    <p>Upon startup, NeoMutt determines the character set on its own using routines that inspect locale-specific environment variables. Therefore, it is generally not necessary to set the
    <code class="literal">$charset</code> variable in NeoMutt. It may even be counter-productive as NeoMutt uses system and library functions that derive the character set themselves and on which NeoMutt has no influence. It's safest to let NeoMutt work out the locale setup itself.</p>
    <p>If you happen to work with several character sets on a regular basis, it's highly advisable to use Unicode and an UTF-8 locale. Unicode can represent nearly all characters in a message at the same time. When not using a Unicode locale, it may happen that you receive messages with characters not representable in your locale. When displaying such a message, or replying to or forwarding it, information may get lost possibly rendering the message unusable (not only for you but also for the recipient, this breakage is not reversible as lost information cannot be guessed).</p>
    <p>A Unicode locale makes all conversions superfluous which eliminates the risk of conversion errors. It also eliminates potentially wrong expectations about the character set between NeoMutt and external programs.</p>
    <p>The terminal emulator used also must be properly configured for the current locale. Terminal emulators usually do
    <span class="emphasis">
      <em>not</em>
    </span>derive the locale from environment variables, they need to be configured separately. If the terminal is incorrectly configured, NeoMutt may display random and unexpected characters (question marks, octal codes, or just random glyphs), format strings may not work as expected, you may not be abled to enter non-ascii characters, and possible more. Data is always represented using bytes and so a correct setup is very important as to the machine, all character sets
    <span class="quote">“
    <span class="quote">look</span>”</span> the same.</p>
    <p>Warning: A mismatch between what system and library functions think the locale is and what NeoMutt was told what the locale is may make it behave badly with non-ascii input: it will fail at seemingly random places. This warning is to be taken seriously since not only local mail handling may suffer: sent messages may carry wrong character set information the
    <span class="emphasis">
      <em>receiver</em>
    </span>has too deal with. The need to set
    <code class="literal">$charset</code> directly in most cases points at terminal and environment variable setup problems, not NeoMutt problems.</p>
    <p>A list of officially assigned and known character sets can be found at
    <a class="ulink" href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets" target="_top">IANA</a>, a list of locally supported locales can be obtained by running
    <code class="literal">locale -a</code>.</p>

    <p>All string patterns in NeoMutt including those in more complex
    <a class="link" href="#patterns" title="3.&#160;Patterns: Searching, Limiting and Tagging">patterns</a> must be specified using regular expressions (regex) in the
    <span class="quote">“
    <span class="quote">POSIX extended</span>”</span> syntax (which is more or less the syntax used by egrep and GNU awk). For your convenience, we have included below a brief description of this syntax.</p>
    <p>The search is case sensitive if the pattern contains at least one upper case letter, and case insensitive otherwise.</p>

      <span class="quote">“
      <span class="quote">\</span>”</span> must be quoted if used for a regular expression in an initialization command:
      <span class="quote">“
      <span class="quote">\\</span>”</span>.</p>
    </div>
    <p>A regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of strings. Regular expressions are constructed analogously to arithmetic expressions, by using various operators to combine smaller expressions.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
      <p>The regular expression can be enclosed/delimited by either " or ' which is useful if the regular expression includes a white-space character. See
      <a class="xref" href="configuration.html#neomuttrc-syntax" title="2.&#160;Syntax of Initialization Files">Syntax of Initialization Files</a> for more information on " and ' delimiter processing. To match a literal " or ' you must preface it with \ (backslash).</p>
    </div>
    <p>The fundamental building blocks are the regular expressions that match a single character. Most characters, including all letters and digits, are regular expressions that match themselves. Any metacharacter with special meaning may be quoted by preceding it with a backslash.</p>
    <p>The period
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">.</span>”</span> matches any single character. The caret
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">^</span>”</span> and the dollar sign
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">$</span>”</span> are metacharacters that respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a line.</p>
    <p>A list of characters enclosed by
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">[</span>”</span> and
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">]</span>”</span> matches any single character in that list; if the first character of the list is a caret
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">^</span>”</span> then it matches any character
    <span class="emphasis">
      <em>not</em>
    </span>in the list. For example, the regular expression
    <span class="emphasis">
      <em>[0123456789]</em>
    </span>matches any single digit. A range of ASCII characters may be specified by giving the first and last characters, separated by a hyphen
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">-</span>”</span>. Most metacharacters lose their special meaning inside lists. To include a literal
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">]</span>”</span> place it first in the list. Similarly, to include a literal
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">^</span>”</span> place it anywhere but first. Finally, to include a literal hyphen
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">-</span>”</span> place it last.</p>
    <p>Certain named classes of characters are predefined. Character classes consist of
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">[:</span>”</span>, a keyword denoting the class, and
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">:]</span>”</span>. The following classes are defined by the POSIX standard in

    <p>A character class is only valid in a regular expression inside the brackets of a character list.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
      <p>Note that the brackets in these class names are part of the symbolic names, and must be included in addition to the brackets delimiting the bracket list. For example,
      <span class="emphasis">
        <em>[[:digit:]]</em>

    <p>Two additional special sequences can appear in character lists. These apply to non-ASCII character sets, which can have single symbols (called collating elements) that are represented with more than one character, as well as several characters that are equivalent for collating or sorting purposes:</p>

          <span class="emphasis">
            <em>[[.ch.]]</em>

      <p>***) The message number ranges (introduced by
      <code class="literal">~m</code>) are even more general and powerful than the other types of ranges. Read on and see
      <a class="xref" href="#message-ranges" title="3.1.1.&#160;Message Ranges">Section&#160;3.1.1, “Message Ranges”</a> below.</p>
      <p>****) These patterns read each message in, and can therefore be much slower. Over IMAP this will entail downloading each message. They can not be used for
      <a class="link" href="configuration.html#score-command" title="22.&#160;Message Scoring">message scoring</a>, and it is recommended to avoid using them for index coloring.</p>
      <p>Special attention has to be paid when using regular expressions inside of patterns. Specifically, NeoMutt's parser for these patterns will strip one level of backslash (
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">\</span>”</span>), which is normally used for quoting. If it is your intention to use a backslash in the regular expression, you will need to use two backslashes instead (
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">\\</span>”</span>).</p>
      <p>You can force NeoMutt to treat
      <span class="emphasis">
        <em>EXPR</em>
      </span>as a simple substring instead of a regular expression by using = instead of ~ in the pattern name. For example,
      <code class="literal">=b *.*</code>will find all messages that contain the literal string
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">*.*</span>”</span>. Simple string matches are less powerful than regular expressions but can be considerably faster.</p>
      <p>For IMAP folders, string matches
      <code class="literal">=b</code>,
      <code class="literal">=B</code>, and
      <code class="literal">=h</code> will be performed on the server instead of by fetching every message. IMAP treats
      <code class="literal">=h</code> specially: it must be of the form
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">header: substring</span>”</span> and will not partially match header names. The substring part may be omitted if you simply wish to find messages containing a particular header without regard to its value.</p>
      <p>Patterns matching lists of addresses (notably c, C, p, P and t) match if there is at least one match in the whole list. If you want to make sure that all elements of that list match, you need to prefix your pattern with
      <span class="quote">“
      <span class="quote">^</span>”</span>. This example matches all mails which only has recipients from Germany.</p>

      <br class="example-break" />
      <p>You can restrict address pattern matching to aliases that you have defined with the "@" modifier. This example matches messages whose recipients are all from Germany, and who are known to your alias list.</p>

        </div>
        <br class="table-break" />
        <p>Lastly, you can also leave either side of the range blank, to make it extend as far as possible. For example,
        <code class="literal">~m ,1</code> has the same meaning as the last example in
        <a class="xref" href="#mnrs-shortcuts" title="Table&#160;4.6.&#160;Message Number Shortcuts">Table&#160;4.6, “Message Number Shortcuts”</a>.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, if a MNR
        <span class="emphasis">
          <em>doesn't</em>
        </span>contain a comma, the meaning is similar to other ranges, except that the shortcuts are still available. Examples:</p>

      </div>
      <p>NeoMutt supports two versions of so called
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">simple searches</span>”</span>. These are issued if the query entered for searching, limiting and similar operations does not seem to contain a valid pattern modifier (i.e. it does not contain one of these characters:
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">~</span>”</span>,
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">=</span>”</span> or
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">%</span>”</span>). If the query is supposed to contain one of these special characters, they must be escaped by prepending a backslash (
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">\</span>”</span>).</p>
      <p>The first type is by checking whether the query string equals a keyword case-insensitively from
      <a class="xref" href="#tab-simplesearch-keywords" title="Table&#160;4.8.&#160;Simple search keywords">Table&#160;4.8, “Simple search keywords”</a>: If that is the case, NeoMutt will use the shown pattern modifier instead. If a keyword would conflict with your search keyword, you need to turn it into a regular expression to avoid matching the keyword table. For example, if you want to find all messages matching
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">flag</span>”</span>(using
      <a class="link" href="reference.html#simple-search" title="3.341.&#160;simple_search">$simple_search</a>) but don't want to match flagged messages, simply search for
      <span class="quote">“

      <p>The second type of simple search is to build a complex search pattern using
      <a class="link" href="reference.html#simple-search" title="3.341.&#160;simple_search">$simple_search</a> as a template. NeoMutt will insert your query properly quoted and search for the composed complex query.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Logical AND is performed by specifying more than one criterion. For example:</p>
      <pre class="screen">
~t work ~f elkins
</pre>
      <p>would select messages which contain the word
      <span class="quote">“
      <span class="quote">work</span>”</span> in the list of recipients
      <span class="emphasis">
        <em>and</em>
      </span>that have the word
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">elkins</span>”</span> in the
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">From</span>”</span> header field.</p>
      <p>NeoMutt also recognizes the following operators to create more complex search patterns:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc;">
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>! – logical NOT operator</p>
          </li>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>| – logical OR operator</p>
          </li>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>() – logical grouping operator</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>Here is an example illustrating a complex search pattern. This pattern will select all messages which do not contain
      <span class="quote">“
      <span class="quote">work</span>”</span> in the
      <span class="quote">“
      <span class="quote">To</span>”</span> or
      <span class="quote">“
      <span class="quote">Cc</span>”</span> field and which are from
      <span class="quote">“
      <span class="quote">elkins</span>”</span>.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <a id="ex-pattern-bool"></a>
        <p class="title">

        </div>
      </div>
      <br class="example-break" />
      <p>Here is an example using white space in the regular expression (note the
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">'</span>”</span> and
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">"</span>”</span> delimiters). For this to match, the mail's subject must match the
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">^Junk +From +Me$</span>”</span> and it must be from either
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Jim +Somebody</span>”</span> or
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Ed +SomeoneElse</span>”</span>:</p>

      <div class="note">

        <p>If a regular expression contains parenthesis, or a vertical bar ("|"), you
        <span class="emphasis">
          <em>must</em>
        </span>enclose the expression in double or single quotes since those characters are also used to separate different parts of NeoMutt's pattern language. For example:
        <code class="literal">~f "user@(home\.org|work\.com)"</code>Without the quotes, the parenthesis wouldn't end. This would be separated to two OR'd patterns:

</pre>
        <p>If you omit the minimum (first) date, and just specify

        <span class="emphasis">
          <em>before</em>
        </span>the given date will be selected. If you omit the maximum (second) date, and specify

        <span class="emphasis">
          <em>after</em>

        <p>You can add error margins to absolute dates. An error margin is a sign (+ or -), followed by a digit, followed by one of the units in

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>There are times that it's useful to ask NeoMutt to "remember" which message you're currently looking at, while you move elsewhere in your mailbox. You can do this with the
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">mark-message</span>”</span> operator, which is bound to the
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">~</span>”</span> key by default. Press this key to enter an identifier for the marked message. When you want to return to this message, press
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">'</span>”</span> and the name that you previously entered.</p>
    <p>(Message marking is really just a shortcut for defining a macro that returns you to the current message by searching for its Message-ID. You can choose a different prefix by setting the
    <a class="link" href="reference.html#mark-macro-prefix" title="3.166.&#160;mark_macro_prefix">$mark_macro_prefix</a> variable.)</p>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Sometimes it is desirable to perform an operation on a group of messages all at once rather than one at a time. An example might be to save messages to a mailing list to a separate folder, or to delete all messages with a given subject. To tag all messages matching a pattern, use the
    <code class="literal">&lt;tag-pattern&gt;</code>function, which is bound to
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">shift-T</span>”</span> by default. Or you can select individual messages by hand using the
    <code class="literal">&lt;tag-message&gt;</code>function, which is bound to
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">t</span>”</span> by default. See
    <a class="link" href="#patterns" title="3.&#160;Patterns: Searching, Limiting and Tagging">patterns</a> for NeoMutt's pattern matching syntax.</p>
    <p>Once you have tagged the desired messages, you can use the
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">tag-prefix</span>”</span> operator, which is the
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">;</span>”</span>(semicolon) key by default. When the
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">tag-prefix</span>”</span> operator is used, the
    <span class="emphasis">
      <em>next</em>
    </span>operation will be applied to all tagged messages if that operation can be used in that manner. If the
    <a class="link" href="reference.html#auto-tag" title="3.24.&#160;auto_tag">$auto_tag</a> variable is set, the next operation applies to the tagged messages automatically, without requiring the
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">tag-prefix</span>”</span>.</p>

      <span class="command">
        <strong>push</strong>
      </span>
    </a>commands, you can use the
    <code class="literal">&lt;tag-prefix-cond&gt;</code>operator. If there are no tagged messages, NeoMutt will
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">eat</span>”</span> the rest of the macro to abort its execution. NeoMutt will stop
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">eating</span>”</span> the macro when it encounters the
    <code class="literal">&lt;end-cond&gt;</code>operator; after this operator the rest of the macro will be executed as normal.</p>

      <span class="command">
        <strong>message-hook</strong>
      </span>,
      <span class="command">
        <strong>reply-hook</strong>
      </span>,
      <span class="command">
        <strong>send-hook</strong>
      </span>,
      <span class="command">
        <strong>send2-hook</strong>
      </span>,
      <span class="command">
        <strong>save-hook</strong>
      </span>,
      <span class="command">
        <strong>fcc-hook</strong>
      </span>) are evaluated in a slightly different manner. For the other types of hooks, a
      <a class="link" href="#regex" title="2.&#160;Regular Expressions">regular expression</a> is sufficient. But in dealing with messages a finer grain of control is needed for matching since for different purposes you want to match different criteria.</p>
      <p>NeoMutt allows the use of the
      <a class="link" href="#patterns" title="3.&#160;Patterns: Searching, Limiting and Tagging">search pattern</a> language for matching messages in hook commands. This works in exactly the same way as it would when
      <span class="emphasis">
        <em>limiting</em>
      </span>or
      <span class="emphasis">
        <em>searching</em>
      </span>the mailbox, except that you are restricted to those operators which match information NeoMutt extracts from the header of the message (i.e., from, to, cc, date, subject, etc.).</p>
      <p>For example, if you wanted to set your return address based upon sending mail to a specific address, you could do something like:</p>
      <pre class="screen">
send-hook '~t ^user@work\.com$' 'my_hdr From: John Smith &lt;user@host&gt;'
</pre>
      <p>which would execute the given command when sending mail to
      <span class="emphasis">
        <em>user@work.com</em>
      </span>.</p>
      <p>However, it is not required that you write the pattern to match using the full searching language. You can still specify a simple
      <span class="emphasis">
        <em>regular expression</em>
      </span>like the other hooks, in which case NeoMutt will translate your pattern into the full language, using the translation specified by the
      <a class="link" href="reference.html#default-hook" title="3.69.&#160;default_hook">$default_hook</a> variable. The pattern is translated at the time the hook is declared, so the value of
      <a class="link" href="reference.html#default-hook" title="3.69.&#160;default_hook">$default_hook</a> that is in effect at that time will be used.</p>

      <a class="link" href="#regex" title="2.&#160;Regular Expressions">regular expression</a> syntax as well as
      <a class="link" href="#shortcuts" title="10.&#160;Mailbox Shortcuts">mailbox shortcut</a> expansion on the regex parameter. There is some overlap between these, so special attention should be paid to the first character of the regex.</p>
      <pre class="screen">
<span class="comment"># Here, ^ will expand to "the current mailbox" not "beginning of string":</span>
folder-hook ^/home/user/Mail/bar "set sort=threads"
<span class="comment"># If you want ^ to be interpreted as "beginning of string", one workaround</span>
<span class="comment"># is to enclose the regex in parenthesis:</span>
folder-hook (^/home/user/Mail/bar) "set sort=threads"
<span class="comment"># This will expand to the default save folder for the alias "imap.example.com", which</span>
<span class="comment"># is probably not what you want:</span>
folder-hook @imap.example.com "set sort=threads"
<span class="comment"># A workaround is to use parenthesis or a backslash:</span>
folder-hook (@imap.example.com) "set sort=threads"
folder-hook '\@imap.example.com' "set sort=threads"
</pre>
      <p>Keep in mind that mailbox shortcut expansion on the regex parameter takes place when the hook is initially parsed, not when the hook is matching against a mailbox. When NeoMutt starts up and is reading the .neomuttrc, some mailbox shortcuts may not be usable. For example, the "current mailbox" shortcut, ^, will expand to an empty string because no mailbox has been opened yet. NeoMutt will issue an error for this case or if the mailbox shortcut results in an empty regex.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>NeoMutt supports connecting to external directory databases such as LDAP, ph/qi, bbdb, or NIS through a wrapper script which connects to NeoMutt using a simple interface. Using the
    <a class="link" href="reference.html#query-command" title="3.285.&#160;query_command">$query_command</a> variable, you specify the wrapper command to use. For example:</p>
    <pre class="screen">
set query_command = "mutt_ldap_query.pl %s"
</pre>
    <p>The wrapper script should accept the query on the command-line. It should return a one line message, then each matching response on a single line, each line containing a tab separated address then name then some other optional information. On error, or if there are no matching addresses, return a non-zero exit code and a one line error message.</p>
    <p>An example multiple response output:</p>
    <pre class="screen">
Searching database ... 20 entries ... 3 matching:
me@cs.hmc.edu           Michael Elkins  mutt dude
blong@fiction.net       Brandon Long    mutt and more
roessler@does-not-exist.org        Thomas Roessler mutt pgp
</pre>
    <p>There are two mechanisms for accessing the query function of NeoMutt. One is to do a query from the index menu using the
    <code class="literal">&lt;query&gt;</code>function (default: Q). This will prompt for a query, then bring up the query menu which will list the matching responses. From the query menu, you can select addresses to create aliases, or to mail. You can tag multiple addresses to mail, start a new query, or have a new query appended to the current responses.</p>
    <p>The other mechanism for accessing the query function is for address completion, similar to the alias completion. In any prompt for address entry, you can use the
    <code class="literal">&lt;complete-query&gt;</code>function (default: ^T) to run a query based on the current address you have typed. Like aliases, NeoMutt will look for what you have typed back to the last space or comma. If there is a single response for that query, NeoMutt will expand the address in place. If there are multiple responses, NeoMutt will activate the query menu. At the query menu, you can select one or more addresses to be added to the prompt.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>NeoMutt supports reading and writing of four different local mailbox formats: mbox, MMDF, MH and Maildir. The mailbox type is auto detected, so there is no need to use a flag for different mailbox types. When creating new mailboxes, NeoMutt uses the default specified with the
    <a class="link" href="reference.html#mbox-type" title="3.171.&#160;mbox_type">$mbox_type</a> variable. A short description of the formats follows.</p>
    <p>
    <span class="emphasis">
      <em>mbox</em>
    </span>. This is a widely used mailbox format for UNIX. All messages are stored in a single file. Each message has a line of the form:</p>
    <pre class="screen">
From me@cs.hmc.edu Fri, 11 Apr 1997 11:44:56 PST
</pre>
    <p>to denote the start of a new message (this is often referred to as the
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">From_</span>”</span> line). The mbox format requires mailbox locking, is prone to mailbox corruption with concurrently writing clients or misinterpreted From_ lines. Depending on the environment, new mail detection can be unreliable. Mbox folders are fast to open and easy to archive.</p>
    <p>
    <span class="emphasis">
      <em>MMDF</em>
    </span>. This is a variant of the
    <span class="emphasis">
      <em>mbox</em>
    </span>format. Each message is surrounded by lines containing
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">^A^A^A^A</span>”</span>(four times control-A's). The same problems as for mbox apply (also with finding the right message separator as four control-A's may appear in message bodies).</p>
    <p>
    <span class="emphasis">
      <em>MH</em>
    </span>. A radical departure from
    <span class="emphasis">
      <em>mbox</em>
    </span>and
    <span class="emphasis">
      <em>MMDF</em>
    </span>, a mailbox consists of a directory and each message is stored in a separate file. The filename indicates the message number (however, this is may not correspond to the message number NeoMutt displays). Deleted messages are renamed with a comma (
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">,</span>”</span>) prepended to the filename. NeoMutt detects this type of mailbox by looking for either
    <code class="literal">.mh_sequences</code> or
    <code class="literal">.xmhcache</code> files (needed to distinguish normal directories from MH mailboxes). MH is more robust with concurrent clients writing the mailbox, but still may suffer from lost flags; message corruption is less likely to occur than with mbox/mmdf. It's usually slower to open compared to mbox/mmdf since many small files have to be read (NeoMutt provides
    <a class="xref" href="optionalfeatures.html#header-caching" title="8.1.&#160;Header Caching">Section&#160;8.1, “Header Caching”</a> to greatly speed this process up). Depending on the environment, MH is not very disk-space efficient.</p>
    <p>
    <span class="emphasis">
      <em>Maildir</em>
    </span>. The newest of the mailbox formats, used by the Qmail MTA (a replacement for sendmail). Similar to
    <span class="emphasis">
      <em>MH</em>
    </span>, except that it adds three subdirectories of the mailbox:
    <span class="emphasis">
      <em>tmp</em>
    </span>,
    <span class="emphasis">
      <em>new</em>
    </span>and
    <span class="emphasis">
      <em>cur</em>
    </span>. Filenames for the messages are chosen in such a way they are unique, even when two programs are writing the mailbox over NFS, which means that no file locking is needed and corruption is very unlikely. Maildir maybe slower to open without caching in NeoMutt, it too is not very disk-space efficient depending on the environment. Since no additional files are used for metadata (which is embedded in the message filenames) and Maildir is locking-free, it's easy to sync across different machines using file-level synchronization tools.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>NeoMutt has a few configuration options that make dealing with large amounts of mail easier. The first thing you must do is to let NeoMutt know what addresses you consider to be mailing lists (technically this does not have to be a mailing list, but that is what it is most often used for), and what lists you are subscribed to. This is accomplished through the use of the
    <a class="link" href="configuration.html#lists" title="12.&#160;Mailing Lists">
      <span class="command">
        <strong>lists</strong>
      </span>
    </a>and
    <a class="link" href="configuration.html#lists" title="12.&#160;Mailing Lists">
      <span class="command">
        <strong>subscribe</strong>
      </span>
    </a>commands in your
    <code class="literal">.neomuttrc</code>. Alternatively or additionally, you can set
    <a class="link" href="reference.html#auto-subscribe" title="3.23.&#160;auto_subscribe">$auto_subscribe</a> to automatically subscribe addresses found in a
    <code class="literal">List-Post</code> header.</p>
    <p>Now that NeoMutt knows what your mailing lists are, it can do several things, the first of which is the ability to show the name of a list through which you received a message (i.e., of a subscribed list) in the
    <span class="emphasis">
      <em>index</em>
    </span>menu display. This is useful to distinguish between personal and list mail in the same mailbox. In the
    <a class="link" href="reference.html#index-format" title="3.153.&#160;index_format">$index_format</a> variable, the expando
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">%L</span>”</span> will print the string
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">To &lt;list&gt;</span>”</span> when
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">list</span>”</span> appears in the
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">To</span>”</span> field, and
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Cc &lt;list&gt;</span>”</span> when it appears in the
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Cc</span>”</span> field (otherwise it prints the name of the author).</p>
    <p>Often times the
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">To</span>”</span> and
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Cc</span>”</span> fields in mailing list messages tend to get quite large. Most people do not bother to remove the author of the message they reply to from the list, resulting in two or more copies being sent to that person. The
    <code class="literal">&lt;list-reply&gt;</code>function, which by default is bound to
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">L</span>”</span> in the
    <span class="emphasis">
      <em>index</em>
    </span>menu and
    <span class="emphasis">
      <em>pager</em>
    </span>, helps reduce the clutter by only replying to the known mailing list addresses instead of all recipients (except as specified by
    <code class="literal">Mail-Followup-To</code>, see below).</p>
    <p>NeoMutt also supports the
    <code class="literal">Mail-Followup-To</code> header. When you send a message to a list of recipients which includes one or several known mailing lists, and if the
    <a class="link" href="reference.html#followup-to" title="3.92.&#160;followup_to">$followup_to</a> option is set, NeoMutt will generate a Mail-Followup-To header. If any of the recipients are subscribed mailing lists, this header will contain all the recipients to whom you send this message, but not your address. This indicates that group-replies or list-replies (also known as
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">followups</span>”</span>) to this message should only be sent to the original recipients of the message, and not separately to you - you'll receive your copy through one of the mailing lists you are subscribed to. If none of the recipients are subscribed mailing lists, the header will also contain your address, ensuring you receive a copy of replies.</p>
    <p>Conversely, when group-replying or list-replying to a message which has a
    <code class="literal">Mail-Followup-To</code> header, NeoMutt will respect this header if the
    <a class="link" href="reference.html#honor-followup-to" title="3.126.&#160;honor_followup_to">$honor_followup_to</a> configuration variable is set. Using
    <a class="link" href="gettingstarted.html#list-reply">list-reply</a> will in this case also make sure that the reply goes to the mailing list, even if it's not specified in the list of recipients in the
    <code class="literal">Mail-Followup-To</code>.</p>
    <div class="note">
      <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
      <p>When header editing is enabled, you can create a
      <code class="literal">Mail-Followup-To</code> header manually. NeoMutt will only auto-generate this header if it doesn't exist when you send the message.</p>
    </div>
    <p>The other method some mailing list admins use is to generate a
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Reply-To</span>”</span> field which points back to the mailing list address rather than the author of the message. This can create problems when trying to reply directly to the author in private, since most mail clients will automatically reply to the address given in the
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Reply-To</span>”</span> field. NeoMutt uses the
    <a class="link" href="reference.html#reply-to" title="3.299.&#160;reply_to">$reply_to</a> variable to help decide which address to use. If set to
    <span class="emphasis">
      <em>ask-yes</em>
    </span>or
    <span class="emphasis">
      <em>ask-no</em>
    </span>, you will be prompted as to whether or not you would like to use the address given in the
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Reply-To</span>”</span> field, or reply directly to the address given in the
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">From</span>”</span> field. When set to
    <span class="emphasis">
      <em>yes</em>
    </span>, the
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Reply-To</span>”</span> field will be used when present.</p>
    <p>You can change or delete the
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">X-Label:</span>”</span> field within NeoMutt using the
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">edit-label</span>”</span> command, bound to the
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">y</span>”</span> key by default. This works for tagged messages, too. While in the edit-label function, pressing the &lt;complete&gt; binding (TAB, by default) will perform completion against all labels currently in use.</p>
    <p>Lastly, NeoMutt has the ability to
    <a class="link" href="reference.html#sort" title="3.372.&#160;sort">sort</a> the mailbox into
    <a class="link" href="gettingstarted.html#threads" title="5.3.&#160;Threaded Mode">threads</a>. A thread is a group of messages which all relate to the same subject. This is usually organized into a tree-like structure where a message and all of its replies are represented graphically. If you've ever used a threaded news client, this is the same concept. It makes dealing with large volume mailing lists easier because you can easily delete uninteresting threads and quickly find topics of value.</p>

    <p>NeoMutt supports setups with multiple folders, allowing all of them to be monitored for new mail (see
    <a class="xref" href="configuration.html#mailboxes" title="14.&#160;Monitoring Incoming Mail">Section&#160;14, “Monitoring Incoming Mail”</a> for details).</p>
    <div class="sect2">

            <h3 class="title">
            <a id="new-mail-formats"></a>13.1.&#160;How New Mail Detection Works</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>For Mbox and Mmdf folders, new mail is detected by comparing access and/or modification times of files: NeoMutt assumes a folder has new mail if it wasn't accessed after it was last modified. Utilities like
      <code class="literal">biff</code> or
      <code class="literal">frm</code> or any other program which accesses the mailbox might cause NeoMutt to never detect new mail for that mailbox if they do not properly reset the access time. Other possible causes of NeoMutt not detecting new mail in these folders are backup tools (updating access times) or filesystems mounted without access time update support (for Linux systems, see the
      <code class="literal">relatime</code> option).</p>
      <div class="note">
        <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
        <p>Contrary to older NeoMutt releases, it now maintains the new mail status of a folder by properly resetting the access time if the folder contains at least one message which is neither read, nor deleted, nor marked as old.</p>
      </div>
      <p>In cases where new mail detection for Mbox or Mmdf folders appears to be unreliable, the
      <a class="link" href="reference.html#check-mbox-size" title="3.36.&#160;check_mbox_size">$check_mbox_size</a> option can be used to make NeoMutt track and consult file sizes for new mail detection instead which won't work for size-neutral changes.</p>
      <p>New mail for Maildir is assumed if there is one message in the
      <code class="literal">new/</code>subdirectory which is not marked deleted (see
      <a class="link" href="reference.html#maildir-trash" title="3.165.&#160;maildir_trash">$maildir_trash</a>). For MH folders, a mailbox is considered having new mail if there's at least one message in the
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">unseen</span>”</span> sequence as specified by
      <a class="link" href="reference.html#mh-seq-unseen" title="3.183.&#160;mh_seq_unseen">$mh_seq_unseen</a>. Optionally,
      <a class="link" href="reference.html#new-mail-command" title="3.195.&#160;new_mail_command">$new_mail_command</a> can be configured to execute an external program every time new mail is detected in the current inbox.</p>
      <p>NeoMutt does not poll POP3 folders for new mail, it only periodically checks the currently opened folder (if it's a POP3 folder).</p>
      <p>For IMAP, by default NeoMutt uses recent message counts provided by the server to detect new mail. If the
      <a class="link" href="reference.html#imap-idle" title="3.136.&#160;imap_idle">$imap_idle</a> option is set, it'll use the IMAP IDLE extension if advertised by the server.</p>
      <p>The
      <a class="link" href="reference.html#mail-check-recent" title="3.158.&#160;mail_check_recent">$mail_check_recent</a> option changes whether NeoMutt will notify you of new mail in an already visited mailbox. When set (the default) it will only notify you of new mail received since the last time you opened the mailbox. When unset, NeoMutt will notify you of any new mail in the mailbox.</p>

      </div>
      <p>When in the index menu and being idle (also see
      <a class="link" href="reference.html#timeout" title="3.404.&#160;timeout">$timeout</a>), NeoMutt periodically checks for new mail in all folders which have been configured via the
      <span class="command">
        <strong>mailboxes</strong>
      </span>command. The interval depends on the folder type: for local/IMAP folders it consults
      <a class="link" href="reference.html#mail-check" title="3.157.&#160;mail_check">$mail_check</a> and
      <a class="link" href="reference.html#pop-checkinterval" title="3.264.&#160;pop_checkinterval">$pop_checkinterval</a> for POP folders.</p>
      <p>Outside the index menu the directory browser supports checking for new mail using the
      <code class="literal">&lt;check-new&gt;</code>function which is unbound by default. Pressing TAB will bring up a menu showing the files specified by the
      <span class="command">
        <strong>mailboxes</strong>
      </span>command, and indicate which contain new messages. NeoMutt will automatically enter this mode when invoked from the command line with the
      <code class="literal">-y</code> option.</p>
      <p>For the pager, index and directory browser menus, NeoMutt contains the
      <code class="literal">&lt;mailbox-list&gt;</code>function (bound to
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">.</span>”</span> by default) which will print a list of folders with new mail in the command line at the bottom of the screen.</p>
      <p>For the index, by default NeoMutt displays the number of mailboxes with new mail in the status bar, please refer to the
      <a class="link" href="reference.html#status-format" title="3.395.&#160;status_format">$status_format</a> variable for details.</p>
      <p>When changing folders, NeoMutt fills the prompt with the first folder from the mailboxes list containing new mail (if any), pressing
      <code class="literal">&lt;Space&gt;</code>will cycle through folders with new mail. The (by default unbound) function
      <code class="literal">&lt;next-unread-mailbox&gt;</code>in the index can be used to immediately open the next folder with unread mail (if any).</p>
