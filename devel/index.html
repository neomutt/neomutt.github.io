<h1>Development</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">What's Going On?</h2>

<h2>Latest Development</h2>

<p>
  There's a <a href="https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt-unstable">new version of NeoMutt</a>
  based on the newly released Mutt-1.7.0.  Although not ready for the general
  public, developers are asked to give it a try and find all the bugs.
</p>


<h2>Development</h2>

<p>
  Any development on features is done in "devel/" feature branches in the
  <a href="https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt">NeoMutt repository</a>.  Once
  development is complete, the work will be moved into a "feature/" branch.
</p>

<p>
  There are more development pages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="github.html">GitHub</a> - Descriptions of all the NeoMutt repositories and how the branches fit together
  <li><a href="coding.html">Coding Style</a> - The preferred style for code committed to NeoMutt
  <li><a href="tasks.html">Tasks</a> - A list of tasks to be done
  <li><a href="obsolescence.html">Obsolescence</a> - A list of old projects that can be forgotten
</ul>

<p>
  Finally, some automatic checking is done on commits and pull-requests for
  NeoMutt.  It benefits from two free services (free for Open Source).  They are
  triggered on every commit to GitHub.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://travis-ci.com/">Travis CI</a> automatically build projects on every commit (Continuous Integration).
  <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/">Coverity</a> performs static analysis on the code looking for potential problems.
</p>

<h2>Blue Sky</h2>

<p>
  NeoMutt also has a couple of speculative ideas:
  <ul>
    <li>Redesigning Mutt's <a href="https://github.com/neomutt/arch#arch">architecture</a></li>
    <li>Redesigning Mutt's <a href="https://github.com/neomutt/panel-manager#panel-manager">gui</a></li>
  </ul>
  <b>Note:</b> These are just toys (for now).
