<h1>GitHub Repositories</h1>

<p>
  All the source code for NeoMutt, and its patches, is available on GitHub.
  The majority is in the <a href="https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt">neomutt
  repo</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Each feature has its own branch in the repo. Any changes to features
  happen there. This means each can be cleanly merged into Mutt.
</p>

<p>
  The NeoMutt branch is mostly merge commits from the feature branches. It
  also contains commits that aren't appropriate to merge into Mutt, such as
  changing the version number.
</p>

<p>
  Here are some diagrams showing alternative release strategies.<br>
  In the future, these release strategies may be adopted instead of the
  "release with hotfixes"
</p>

<h3>Periodic Release</h3>

<p>
  After a period of time, all the features are merged into NeoMutt and a
  release is made.<br>
  The features are merged immediately before a release is made.
</p>

<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Two commits are made to the features</li>
  <li>Features are merged into NeoMutt</li>
  <li>Release <strong>R<sup>1</sup></strong> is made</li>

  <li>Time passes (// on diagram)</li>

  <li>Release <strong>R<sup>2</sup></strong> is made</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advanced</h3>
<p>
  This is the same as the hotfix method, but also incorporated the latest
  development features.
