<h2>Development</h2>

<p>
  Any development on features is done in "devel/" feature branches in the
  <a href="https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt">NeoMutt repository</a>.  Once
  development is complete, the work will be merged into the "neomutt" branch.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, some automatic checking is done on commits and pull-requests for
  NeoMutt.  It benefits from two free services (free for Open Source).  They are
  triggered on every commit to GitHub.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://travis-ci.com/">Travis CI</a> automatically build projects on every commit (Continuous Integration).
  <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/">Coverity</a> performs static analysis on the code looking for potential problems.
</p>

<h2> Tips for using Github</h2>
<ul>
    <li>We use Github's "assignee" feature to communicate who's working on what.
    With links like this one: <a
    href="https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues?q=is:issue%20is:open%20no:assignee">
    Github Search for no assignee's</a> you can view every issue with no neomutt
    member working on it. </li>
    <li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/"> Github's
    documentation for searching through issue's and Pull Requests.</a> </li>
</ul>

<h2>Development Docs</h2>

<table summary="list of dev">
  <thead>
    <tr>

      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    {% for f in site.dev %}
      <tr>
        <td><a href="{{ f.url }}">{{ f.title }}</a></td>
        <td>{{ f.description }}</td>
      </tr>
    {% endfor %}
  </tbody>

<h2>Blue Sky</h2>

<p>
  NeoMutt also has a couple of speculative ideas:
  <ul>
    <li>Redesigning Mutt's <a href="https://github.com/neomutt/arch#arch">architecture</a></li>
    <li>Redesigning Mutt's <a href="https://github.com/neomutt/panel-manager#panel-manager">gui</a></li>
  </ul>
  <b>Note:</b> These are just toys (for now).
