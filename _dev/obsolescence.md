The state, process, or condition of being or becoming out of date

## Searching

If you search for "mutt" on GitHub, Bitbucket, etc. you will find \>700
repositories. There are a lot of people who thought that Mutt needed
something extra.

Most of the repos contain the same features, e.g. Sidebar, Index Color.
Unfortunately, each repo was created at a different time with a different
version of the patch and occasionally different bug fixes.

Richard Russon [(FlatCap)](https://github.com/flatcap) examined
all these repos and determined what should be preserved. The results are
saved in the [community repo](https://github.com/neomutt/community).

## Making releases

Searching and categorising these repos took a lot of time. It means that when
a NeoMutt release is made, we can categorically say: "This is the only
version you'll need".

Alternatively, "This NeoMutt version obsoletes this list of versions".
