If you're new to [NeoMutt](/about.html), here's a list of things you need to know.

## Contact

The NeoMutt developers are scattered all over the globe.  To keep in touch they
use [GitHub](https://github.com/neomutt), [IRC](#irc) and [mailing lists](#email).

### IRC <a class="offset" id="irc"></a>

Channel: **#neomutt** on **irc.freenode.net**

This is a good way to meet the developers if you want to say hello.  Everyone's
welcome.  There are usually about 60 people / lurkers in the channel.

The channel is pretty informal and conversation ranges from deep technical
discussions to light-hearted nonsense (late at night).

If you don't have a IRC client, you can use FreeNode's
[web client](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=neomutt).

### Mailing lists <a class="offset" id="email"></a>

NeoMutt has two moderated mailing lists: Users, Devel.

**NeoMutt Users** <small>(>60 people)</small>

This list is ideal for new users of NeoMutt and people wanting to learn more.

All non-technical NeoMutt discussions are welcome here.

- What's your favourite feature?
- Do you have a killer config file?
- Have you found a bug?
- Do you want some help?

When asking for help, remember that we're volunteers.
(and please check Google first :-)

**NeoMutt Developers** (~40 people)

This is a technical list, used for discussing the code, build and documentation of NeoMutt.

Users of rolling releases, such as Arch and Homebrew (OSX) are advised to join,
to get early warning of new bugs.

Discussions here are likely to be about:

- Bugs
- Features
- Code
- Distros
- Enhancements
- Git

**Mailing List Guidelines**

**Please:**

- Send emails in plain text, not HTML
- Use an informative subject line
- Keep attachments small, or better still: link to the files
- Remember that we're volunteers and we may take a while to reply

## GitHub <a class="offset" id="github"></a>

If you're a GitHub user, there are lots of ways to keep informed about NeoMutt
development.

First, though, please
[**star our project**](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt)
to show your appreciation :-)

The project consists of about 20 git repositories.  They store the code that
makes up NeoMutt, the documentation, build scripts and experiments
([read more about them](repos)).

GitHub allows you to watch:
- **Repos** -- Choose a repository and click the **Watch** button
- **Issues** -- Open an issue and click **Subscribe** in the right-hand panel
- **Pull-Requests** -- Open a PR and click **Subscribe** in the right-hand panel
- **People** -- Go to a person's home page and click **Follow** on the left

By watching things in GitHub, you will receive emails when events occur.
See your [notifications](https://github.com/settings/notifications) and
[emails](https://github.com/settings/emails) settings for more information.

## Invitation  <a class="offset" id="invite"></a>

This section is for people who have been invited to join the NeoMutt project.
Invites will be given to people who contribute: code, docs, translations
(it's a very inclusive club :-)

**Thank you for your contribution and Welcome to NeoMutt**.

Accepting an invitation does two things.  It shows your support for the project
and it allows you to commit work directly to the project.  Members can commit to
most branches of most repos.  Everything is backed up, but please be careful :-)

When you join, please consider making your membership public.  Being a public
member will add a NeoMutt icon to your home page and it will tag any comments
you make in the issues.

- **Translators** -- [how to translate NeoMutt](translate-strings)
