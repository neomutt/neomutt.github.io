# {{ page.description }}

NeoMutt is very popular and its users come up with lots of great new ideas.

## Downside

Unfortunately NeoMutt's development team is quite small, so they can't
implement everything.

Below is a list of the issues where either the developers have no interest in
or can't help with.

They are closed for now, but they can be re-opened if someone volunteers to do
the work. Help will be freely given to volunteers. Issues where the result is
hard to achieve are labeled with
[![difficulty-hard](/images/labels/difficulty-hard.svg)](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Adifficulty%3Ahard).
Please note, those hard issues are intentionally closed -- they are sometimes
demotivating due to its difficulty.
