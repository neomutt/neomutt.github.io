**Note**: This is still work in progress and not at all fixed! For the
discussion, see [#346](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/436).

## motivation

@flatcap said he's being reluctant to change the build system, because he
doesn't know which Operating system or architecture that would break.

## cmake supported platforms

As we thought about changing the build sytem to cmake (See [this issue for
that](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/321) for the discussion), 
[the list of platforms cmake does support may be interesting.

## Architectures

### confirmed

I think it makes sense to orientate ourselves at
[NetBSD](http://netbsd.net/releases/formal-7/NetBSD-7.0.2.html#system-families),
because it probably supports every platform debian, freeBSD, OpenBSD, etc.
support and beyond.

Our NetBSD maintainer
[@0-wiz-0](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/436#issuecomment-282689847)
said, although neomutt doesn't build on every of those architectures (due to the
lack of build machines) all those architectures share mostly the same code.
Therfore, he doesn't expect many troubles.

Of course, my argument in the section [Operating Systems // not desirable to
support](#not-desirable-to-support) also can be applies here: Its difficult to
provide support for all the above architectures, because of us probably have
only a amd64 machine.

## Operating Systems

([Source](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/blob/135b1bfa9bd10336b93a25bdaf6112dc4c77df46/INSTALL#L7-L27))

### confirmed

For the following, we expect not many troubles to build neomutt. Many of those
have a dedicated maintainer and a great amount of users.

* FreeBSD
* Linux
* Mac OS X
* NetBSD
* OpenBSD

### confirmation missing

* SCO Unix -  Latest release: 2015, recent versions are based on FreeBSD
* Solaris

### not desirable to support

For the followinG OS's, I'm reluctant to call neomutt to support them. All of
those are in my opinion a bit hard to get, not very popular or discontinued.

(I have the release dates from wikipedia)

* BSDI - seems to be legacy
* Digital Unix (OSF/1) - discontinued, proprietary
* QNX - proprietary, Latest release: 2014
* IRIX - discontinued
* HP-UX - proprietary
* DYNIX/ptx - legacy system
* AIX - proprietary, Latest release: October 5, 2015
* Data General Unix (DG/UX) - discontinued in 2001
* UnixWare - proprietary, Latest release:  June 10, 2013
* Convex - [old Supercomputer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_Computer)
* Ultrix - proprietary, Latest release: 1995
* Atari MiNT - open source. Latest release: 18 March 2013
* MkLinux - Latest release: August 5, 2002
* SunOS - proprietary, Latest release: November 1994
