## Introduction

This guide will show all the stages in setting up the Sidebar in an event-driven
NeoMutt.  It will list all the objects, their owners, and all the possible
events that could affect the Sidebar.

## Set Up

NeoMutt initialised
- config read
- sidebar init called
  - register config
  - register colours
  - register commands
  - register functions
- root windows created

Index
- open mailbox
- start index dialog

- create dialog
  - create containers
  - create index, index bar
  - create pager, pager bar
  - create sidebar
    - create window
    - attach data
    - set up observers
- attach data to dialog
- create MailboxView, notify
  - sidebar will observe
- create EmailViews, notify

## Data Required

<img width="800" src="https://flatcap.org/mutt/event/sidebar.svg">

- SidebarView
- Account List
- Mailbox List for each Account
- MailboxView for each Mailbox
- SBEntries[]
- Index markers (4)

## Updating

All events begin in the event loop which waits for external events to happen.
e.g.

- Key presses are converted into functions
- Terminal resize causes the Root Window to be resized

Anything that causes a change to a Subject (Data, View, Window, etc) will cause
a notification to be sent out.  The observer can then respond.

**Note**: The observer doesn't take action yet.  That will happen in the reflow or recalc stages.

After the event has been processed, the screen panels will be given a chance to refresh themselves.
This happens in three stages:

- :left_right_arrow: Reflow: If any windows have changed, the layout will be recalculated.  
  Any Windows that are resized will be notified.

- :gear: Recalc: If any Data has changed, the panels can recalculated what's needed to refresh the screen.  
  This step may be time-consuming.

- :paintbrush: Repaint: This step should be an instantaneous redrawing of the panel.

## Events

Below is an exhaustive list of every event that affects the Sidebar.

| :------------------ | :------------- | :------------ |

| unsidebar_whitelist | Displayed text | :gear: recalc |

#### Window Changes

These changes are the effect of other events, e.g. resizing the terminal,
changing config.  In some cases the result will depend on the exact setup of the
screen.  When possible, the Sidebar will **just** be repainted.

| Window Change   | Result                  | Notes                                                                 |
| :-------------- | :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Become taller   | :gear: recalc           | Only if there is more text to display, otherwise :paintbrush: repaint |
| Become shorter  | :heavy_check_mark: none | Unless highlight is moved offscreen, in which case :gear: recalc      |
| Become narrower | :gear: recalc           | Affects sidebar_format                                                |
| Become wider    | :gear: recalc           | Affects sidebar_format                                                |
| Become moved    | :paintbrush: repaint    | If dimensions are the same, otherwise :gear: recalc                   |
| Become visible  | :paintbrush: repaint    | If nothing else has changed, otherwise :gear: recalc                  |
| Become hidden   | :heavy_check_mark: none | Ignore :gear: recalc requests while hidden                            |

## Examples

These examples list all the notifications involved in some common tasks.

### Config

User sources a config file.

**Processing**
- Config: `color error white red`  
  Sidebar: No action (not relevant)

- Config: `color indicator white blue`  
  Sidebar: No action (sidebar_indicator is set)

- Config: `color sidebar_flagged black yellow`  
  Sidebar: Relevant, add repaint flag to Sidebar Window

- Config: `color sidebar_divider brightblack default`  
  Sidebar: Relevant, add repaint flag to Sidebar Window

**Update**
- :left_right_arrow: Reflow: no action
- :gear: Recalc: no action
- :paintbrush: Repaint: Sidebar is repainted

:bulb: **Note**: Repaint flag is set twice, but the Sidebar is only repainted once

### Resize

User makes the terminal shorter.

**Processing**
- Terminal resized
- NeoMutt receives `SIGWINCH`
- Root Window is resized to new dimensions

**Update**
- :left_right_arrow: Reflow: Window sizes are recalculated
  - Sidebar is now shorter, so notification sent
  - Sidebar decides that recalculation is necessary (highlight isn't on-screen)
- :gear: Recalc: Sidebar recalculates screen text and set repaint flag
- :paintbrush: Repaint: Sidebar is repainted

:bulb: **Note**: If the highlight had still been on-screen after the resize, the Sidebar would not have needed to recalc or repaint.

## Independence

The goal is to make the Sidebar completely independent.
Achieving this would mean that a developer could then create a new panel without
having to change large amounts of core code.

An independent panel would need to be able to dynamically define its own:

- **Config**: This is already possible
- **Colours**: More work is required to encapsulate the colours
- **Functions**: Work is needed to make the functions extensible
- **Commands**: Work is needed to make the commands extensible
- **Windows**: Dialog/window notifications would allow a panel to insert itself into the window tree
