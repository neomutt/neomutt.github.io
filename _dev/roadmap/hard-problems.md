Here's a list of problems, which are either

* very difficult to solve
* or very timeconsuming

However, everything listed in here would be a **big** help for us if you'd fix
it. The reason we haven't done that already is mostly the missing time of our
core developers team.

### Refactoring the code and its build system, making Mutt testable

This is probably the problem, we would profit the most from your help. We are
a small team of programmers with even smaller amount of freetime, so big
changes take their time.

But please, if you are interested in this, send a mail to
[neomutt-devel@neomutt.org](mailto:neomutt-devel@neomutt.org)
and descibe your thoughts.

For some ideas, please see:
