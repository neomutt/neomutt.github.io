# {{ page.title }}

Please document your changes.  Note that there are several places where you may
have to add documentation:

- doc/manual.xml.{head,tail} contain The Manual.

- doc/muttrc.man.{head,tail} contain an abridged version of The
  Manual in nroff format (see man(7)), which deals with configuration file
  commands.

- UPDATING includes short documentation of user-visible
  changes, i.e., any incompatibilities should go here.

Configuration _variables_ are documented directly in init.h.   Note that this
includes documentation for possibly added format flags!

The parts of The Manual and the muttrc manual page dealing with these variables,
and the global Muttrc, are generated automatically from that documentation.  To
start this process, type "make update-doc" in the top-level source directory.

Note that you may have to update the makedoc utility (makedoc.c) when adding new
data types to init.h.

More precisely, variable name, type, and default value are directly extracted
from the initializer for the MuttVars array. Documentation is expected in
special comments which _follow_ the initializer.  For a line to be included with
the documentation, it must (after, possibly, some white space) begin with either
"/**" or "**".  Any following white space is ignored. The rest of the line is
expected to be plain text, with some formatting instructions roughly similar to
[ntg]roff:

 - \fI switches to italics

 - \fB switches to boldface

 - \fT switches to monospace

 - \fP switches to normal display after \fI, \fB or \fT

 - \(as can be used to represent an asterisk (*).  This is intended
   to help avoiding character sequences such as /* or */ inside comments.

 - \(rs can be used to represent a backslash (\).  This is intended
   to help avoiding problems when trying to represent any of the \ sequences
   used by makedoc.

 - .dl on a line starts a "definition list" environment (name taken
    from HTML) where terms and definitions alternate.

 - .dt marks a term in a definition list.

 - .dd marks a definition in a definition list.

 - .de on a line finishes a definition list environment.

 - .ts on a line starts a "verbose tscreen" environment (name taken from
   SGML).  Please try to keep lines inside such an environment short; a length
   of about 40 characters should be OK.  This is necessary to avoid a really
   bad-looking muttrc (5) manual page.

 - .te on a line finishes this environment.

 - .pp on a line starts a paragraph.

 - $word will be converted to a reference to word, where appropriate.
   Note that $$word is possible as well.  Use $$$ to get a literal $ without
   making a reference.

 - '. ' in the beginning of a line expands to two space characters.
   This is used to protect indentations in tables.

Do _not_ use any other SGML or nroff formatting instructions here!

For the complete list, you can always look up the .travis.yml files. Note that
these are the ubuntu packages.
