<h2>I want to help NeoMutt</h2>

<p>
  Brilliant. There are lots of ways you can contribute to the NeoMutt project.
  Whatever your skills, or time available, <b>you can help</b>.
</p>

<ul>
    <li> Are you an experienced programmer? Do you want a challenge? Please have a look at
        <a href="/dev/hard-problems">collection of hard problems</a>
    </li>

    <li>
        You don't have much experience? You are not an experienced programmer? Or, you just don't know how to write C?
        Then, please have a look at our <a href="/dev/newbie-tutorial">Newbie Tutorial</a>.
        However, you can still try one of the
        <a href="/dev/hard-problems">hard problems</a> later, if you want. Remember, the question
        is not how much experience you have. Its how much you want to learn.
