When editing your email, hide headers that aren't in use with this config:

```vim
syntax match hide_header "^\v(cc|bcc|reply-to): *$" containedin=mailHeaderKey
highlight hide_header guifg=#606060
```

Empty fields, e.g. `Reply-To:` will be greyed out.

Make this automatic by changing your `.vimrc` to include:
You'll need to adjust this if you've set NeoMutt's `$tmpdir`

```vim
autocmd BufRead /tmp/neomutt-* source ~/.vim/neomutt.vim
```
