# Downloads

NeoMutt is a small project, so we don't support all platforms, yet.
Hopefully, you can find an install method that suits you.

## Problems

If you have a problem with NeoMutt, please let us know.

If you are a GitHub user, you can **[raise an issue](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues)**.

Alternatively, you can contact [Richard&nbsp;Russon](mailto:rich@flatcap.org).

## Source Code

If you're a developer, or you want to be certain what you're running, then the
source code is the place to start.  It can be downloaded from the **Git
repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt
```

Alternatively, the
[Releases Page](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/releases/latest)
has links to the **source** and the individual **patches**.
