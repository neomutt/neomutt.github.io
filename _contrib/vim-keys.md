## Vi-keys for Mutt

Now's the time to let your finger **Rest In Peace** without those weird
combination. And of course, don't just let your time to learn Vi be wasted.

## Quick Start

Add the file and your `~/.mutt` and add `source vim-keys.rc` to your
`~/.mutt/muttrc`.

1. Rolling cursors: `H`, `M`, `L`, `^E`, `^Y`, `^F`, `^B`, `^D`, `^U` and of
   course `gg`, `G`
2. Deleting stuffs: `dt`, `dT`, `dd` (*T*hread)
3. Folding origami: `za`, `zA` (*A*lternate)
4. Coming soon... (And must be aligned)

## TODO

- [ ] **&#x26A0;** Visual + Interactive Vi-key cheat sheet for Mutt (similar to
  sheet.shiar.nl)
- [ ] Maybe remove `dd` since it's hard to press?
- [ ] How about a command mode (for real power!)**, isn't there `:`?**
- [ ] **What is** :g/spam/d
- [ ] :q (I type this way too often) **(me too)**
