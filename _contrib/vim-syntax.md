# Vim Syntax

Vim installs lots of syntax-highlighting files, including one for Mutt.
However, it doesn't include all the new variables, commands and functions that NeoMutt has introduced.

This file [neomutt-syntax.vim](neomutt-syntax.vim.txt) has all the latest NeoMutt bits.

It will always be available here and should be installed by your distro soon.
