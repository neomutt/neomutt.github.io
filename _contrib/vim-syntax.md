Vim installs lots of syntax-highlighting files, including one for Mutt.
However, it doesn't include all the new variables, commands and functions that
NeoMutt has introduced.

This file
[neomutt-syntax.vim](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt.vim/blob/master/syntax/neomuttrc.vim)
has all the latest NeoMutt bits.

It will always be available here and should be installed by your distro soon.
