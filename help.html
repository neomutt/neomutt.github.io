<h1>Help Us</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">Please get involved</h2>

<h2>I need help</h2>

<p>
  Oh, sorry to hear that.  If you are a GitHub user, you can raise a
  <a href="https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt.github.io/issues">Website issue</a> or a
  <a href="https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues">NeoMutt code issue</a>.
<p>

<p>
  Alternatively, you can join the NeoMutt IRC channel:
  <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/neomutt">irc://irc.freenode.net/neomutt</a>, or
  contact the lead developer, Richard&nbsp;Russon&nbsp;<a href="mailto:rich@flatcap.org">&lt;rich@flatcap.org&gt;</a>
</p>

<h2>I want to help NeoMutt</h2>

<p>
  Brilliant.  There are lots of ways you can contribute to the NeoMutt project.
  Whatever your skills, or time available, <b>you can help</b>.  Have a look
  through the list below, pick something you'd like to do and contact
  Richard&nbsp;Russon&nbsp;<a href="mailto:rich@flatcap.org">&lt;rich@flatcap.org&gt;</a>
</p>

<h2>Coding</h2>
<h3 class="subtitle">Fix and improve Mutt</h3>

<p>
  Do you want to fix Mutt?<br>
  Do you want to add new features to Mutt?
</p>

<p>
  <b>Easy Coding Tasks</b> now available:
  <a class="rm" href="/2016/10/07/news">Read more...</a></dd>
</p>

<p>
  Whatever your level of skill, NeoMutt has got a task for you.
  There are lots of simple jobs (to get you familiar with the code) and lots of
  hard jobs to get you thinking.
</p>

<p>
  Alternatively, you could add a new feature to Mutt.
  There are many great Mutt patches that have been neglected.
  They need to be brought up-to-date and merged into Mutt.
</p>

<p>
  Over its twenty year life, Mutt has gathered 84,000 lines of code and a
  lot of cruft (messy code and bad habits).  It's time to sort out the mess and
  make Mutt robust.
</p>

<h2>Docs/Translation</h2>
<h3 class="subtitle">Help Everyone to Understand Mutt</h3>

<p>
  The <a href="/guide/">Mutt guide</a> reads like an encyclopaedia.  Everything
  you want to know is in there somewhere, but generally you have to know what
  you're looking for.
</p>

<p>
  Mutt needs a simple introduction with pictures.
  The guide should explain how to perform simple tasks
  (just the basics to get a user started).
  The simple guide can list some more advanced features of Mutt, but leave a
  full explanation to the main manual.
</p>

<p>
  The Mutt program has been translated into 29 languages, but the manual is in
  English.  This means that many non-English speakers miss out.
  By translating the manual into other languages, you help bring Mutt to a wider
  audience.
</p>

<h2>Web Design</h2>
<h3 class="subtitle">Make the NeoMutt project Look Good</h3>

<p>
  This website was created by a programmer &ndash; it shows.
  If you think you could do a better job, prove it.
</p>

<p>
  The site contains information from quite a lot of sources.
  Most of it has been pulled together by hand.
  These processes need to be automated to reduce effort.
</p>

<h2>Social</h2>
<h3 class="subtitle">Help NeoMutt reach a wider audience.</h3>

<p>
  The NeoMutt project has a
  <a href="https://github.com/neomutt">GitHub organisation</a>
  and a website
  <a href="{{site.url}}">{{site.url}}</a>
</p>

<p>
  These are useful and practical, but in order to reach a wider audience we
  probably need a Twitter and Facebook presence.
</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<h3 class="subtitle">I bet you can't break it</h3>

<p>
  NeoMutt already contains lots of features that Mutt doesn't have.
  These features were often only available as patches which meant that they
  didn't get much testing.
</p>

<p>
  Do you know to to use automatic testing tools?
  What tools exist to test text-only programs like Mutt?
  How easy is it to set up tests?
  What are these tools capable of?
</p>

<p>
  If you find a bug in NeoMutt, please report it:
  <a href="https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues">NeoMutt issue</a>.
</p>

<h2>Ideas</h2>
<h3 class="subtitle">What is Mutt missing?</h3>

<p>
  Even if you don't have any technical skills, you can probably help here.
  As a mail client, Mutt is missing many features common to modern programs.
  Help compile a list of features that Mutt is missing; help guide development.
</p>

<h2>Packager</h2>
<h3 class="subtitle">Packages will bring NeoMutt to a wider audience</h3>

<p>
  NeoMutt is currently only available as source code / patches.
  NeoMutt is a small project and creating and maintaining binary packages takes
  time.
</p>

<p>
  We need someone to create binary packages of NeoMutt.
  A good way to do this would be to set up a
  Debian <abbr title="Personal Package Archive">PPA</abbr> or
  Fedora <abbr title="Cool Other Package Repo">COPR</abbr>.
</p>

<p>
  Automatic packaging, and release, would mean more users, more testing and
  better quality.
</p>

<h2>Mentoring</h2>
<h3 class="subtitle">Help others to help NeoMutt</h3>

<p>
  Mutt has very few developers.  This won't change until the Mutt community
  becomes more welcoming to new developers.
</p>

<p>
  Do you know Mutt well?
  Do you want to encourage others to help?
</p>

<p>
  Richard Russon has compiled a list of simple coding tasks.
  Each task will improve the state of the Mutt code and help to get new
  developers familiar with Mutt.
</p>

<p>
  The job of the mentor will be to:
  <ol>
    <li>Answer the new coder's questions about Mutt</li>
    <li>Check the work</li>
    <li>Help get the code accepted into Mutt</li>
  </ol>
</p>
