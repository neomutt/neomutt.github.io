<h1>NeoMutt Website</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">What's it made of?</h2>

<p>
  This is the website of <a href="/about.html">The NeoMutt Project</a>. It was
  created by Richard Russon (<a href="https://github.com/flatcap">FlatCap</a>).
</p>

<p>
  The site is hosted at <a href="{{site.url}}">{{site.url}}</a>
  by <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> on their
  <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The pages were created using a mix of HTML and
  <a href="https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html">Kramdown</a>, a flavour of Markdown
  They are then processed by
  <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> (a static-website generator).
</p>

<p>
  The site's theme is loosely based on Scott Emmons'
  <a href="https://github.com/scotte/jekyll-clean">Jekyll-Clean</a>.
  It also uses Twitter's <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>
  framework and a colour scheme from Ian Wootten's
  <a href="https://github.com/iwootten/jekyll-syntax">jekyll-syntax</a>
  collection.
