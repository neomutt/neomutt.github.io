<h2>What is NeoMutt?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>NeoMutt is a project of projects.</li>
  <li>A place to gather all the patches against Mutt.</li>
  <li>A place for all the developers to gather.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Hopefully this will build the community and reduce duplicated effort.
</p>

<h3>"NeoMutt"?</h3>

<p>
  NeoMutt is just a name.  When <a href="https://github.com/flatcap">FlatCap</a>
  created the project, he needed a name that was unused on GitHub.
</p>

<h3>Is it a Fork?</h3>

<p>
  It's not a fork of Mutt.<br>
  It's a large set of feature patches (big and small) that apply to Mutt-1.6.2.
</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Reduce duplication</li>
  <li>Get patches in a state to be accepted upstream</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Many hundreds of Mutt users have taken the time to patch Mutt to add features.
  Unfortunately, it's usually the same patches as everyone else and effort is
  wasted.
</p>

<p>
  Also, there are some heroic developers who have been maintaining multi-thousand
  line patches:
  <ul>
    <li>Notmuch patch &gt;4 years</li>
    <li>Sidebar patch &gt;10 years</li>
    <li>NNTP patch &gt;15 years</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>What's been done so far?</h2>

<h3>Additions to Mutt</h3>

<p>
  <a href="/feature/sidebar/">Sidebar</a> has been completely overhauled,
  merging features, fixing bugs, tidying code and documenting the results.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="/feature/notmuch/">Notmuch</a> has been brought up-to-date, against
  Mutt-1.6.2.  It has been split out of the
  <a href="https://github.com/karelzak/mutt-kz">mutt-kz repo</a> and refactored
  slightly.
</p>

<p>
  19 other <a href="/features.html">Features</a> have been tidied and documented.
</p>

<p>
  Stable features will be pushed into branches in the
  <a href="https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt">NeoMutt repo</a>.
</p>

<h2>What's next?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>More Features</li>
    <ul>
      <li>There are a few more features that may be appealing to a larger audience.</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Lots of bugfixes</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The downstream Distros have a lot of bugfixes that need integrating</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Better Sidebar Integration</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Sidebar and Notmuch should work better together</li>
      <li>NNTP would really benefit from using Sidebar</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Getting Changes Accepted Upstream</li>
</ul>
